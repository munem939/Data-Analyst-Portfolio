## Automated Spatial Mapping of D/G Ratios in Raman Spectroscopy Data Using Python

This Python script processes Raman spectroscopy data from multiple text files, calculating the intensity ratio of the D and G peaks (D/G Ratio) for each file. The program systematically extracts x and y coordinates from file names, reads data, applies signal smoothing, and computes the D/G Ratio. The results are organized into a 2D array representing a spatial map. The script then generates a contour plot using matplotlib, providing insights into the spatial distribution of D/G Ratios. Additionally, the script records the execution time, enhancing efficiency assessment. Overall, it automates complex data analysis tasks, aiding researchers in visualizing and interpreting Raman spectroscopy results
