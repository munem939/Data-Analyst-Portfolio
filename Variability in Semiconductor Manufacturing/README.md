# A Comprehensive Analysis of the Variation in SiO2 Film Deposition Thicknesses During Manufacturing


Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio project, "A Comprehensive Analysis of the Variation in SiO2 Film Deposition Thicknesses During Manufacturing." In this project, I leverage my proficiency in Excel and Tableau to conduct a thorough analysis of SiO2 film deposition thicknesses, showcasing both my analytical and data visualization skills.

I trust that this project provides valuable insights into my capabilities as a data analyst, and I appreciate your consideration.

## Introduction

This report investigates into the variability of silicon dioxide (SiO2) film deposition thickness in thin film growth processes, a crucial step in semiconductor manufacturing. The target thickness for SiO2film is set at 2000 microns (μm), also referred as 2 millimetres (mm), and maintaining precision in deposition is essential for optimal semiconductor device functionality.

## Summary of Key Metrics:

**Deposition Sources Analysis:**

Source 1:
  -	Median Thickness: 1996 μm
  -	Average Thickness: 1995.11 μm
  -	Standard Deviation: 7.53 μm

Source 2:
  -	Median Thickness: 2000.50 μm
  -	Average Thickness: 2005.19 μm
  -	Standard Deviation: 14.87 μm

**Outliers and Variation:**
-	Source 1 demonstrates a near-symmetrical result with an average close to the median, while Source 2 exhibits a higher average, indicative of potential outliers with thicknesses exceeding desired expectations.
-	The standard deviation for Source 2 is higher, suggesting a wider spread of thicknesses

**Site-Specific Variations:**
-	Thickness variations across different sites (Site 1, Site 2 and Site 3) on the same wafer are observed.
-	Standard deviations indicate consistent variation across sites, with differences within approximately 2 μm for both deposition sources.

## Recommendations

-	Further optimization of the deposition process is recommended to minimize outliers and achieve more consistent SiO2 film thicknesses, particularly for Source 2.
-	Implementing robust monitoring and control measures is crucial to minimize variations and maintain SiO2 film thickness closer to the target requirement of 2000 μm.
-	Site 2 consistently shows a lower SiO2 film thickness compared to other sites. This site-specific variation should be considered in device development in that area.
