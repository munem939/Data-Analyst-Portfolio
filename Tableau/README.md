## Optimizing Thin Film Deposition for Manufacturing Efficiency

- This data investigates into the variability of silicon dioxide (SiO2) film deposition thickness in thin film growth processes on a silicon wafer, a crucial step in semiconductor manufacturing.
- The target thickness for SiO2film is set at 2000 microns (Î¼m), also referred as 2 millimetres (mm), and maintaining precision in deposition is essential for optimal semiconductor device functionality.
- Two different thin film deposition sources were utilised and measurements were performed across 3 different sites on the silicon wafer

## Market Trend Analysis of Video Game Sales

- Demonstrating substantial sales figures, the DS and PS2 led in game releases. Meanwhile, Xbox 360, PS3, and PS2 showcased parallel global sales, signifying their joint market dominance in distinct eras.
- Notably, action game sales soared on home consoles like the PS2, Xbox 360, and PS3, requiring external displays. In contrast, handheld consoles like the DS and PSP saw a prevalence of miscellaneous and puzzle games in their releases.
- This trend is likely influenced by the handheld consoles' target audience, catering to younger individuals and those with on-the-go lifestyles, who prefer shorter gaming sessions.
